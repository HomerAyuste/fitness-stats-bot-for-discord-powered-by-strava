        Fitness Stats Bot for Discord (Powered by Strava)
    </h1>
</div>

**This is still a work in progress.**

This Discord Bot provides fitness stats for you using Strava and sends embedded Discord messages with stats and graphs.

The repository contains the code for a Python-based Discord bot. The bot is currently self-hosted with Docker and makes use of the following packages:

- [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) - A library for creating interactive message menus in Discord
- [stravalib](https://github.com/stravalib/stravalib) - A Python package for accessing Strava data from the Strava V3 web service

(Note: the bot is almost never running at the moment except for testing)

[Server link](https://discord.gg/eXr876pt9Y) if you would like to chat with me about the bot or find other Strava users on Discord.

## Installation

If you would like to host this bot on your own machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` to repo root
3. (Optional) [Create a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
4. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install packages needed (step only needed if not using Docker)
5. Create a configuration file:
     * The easiest way is to make a file called `.env` in the repository root, with the following format:
      ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN = ...
    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET = ...
    STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET = ...
    STRAVA_CLIENT_ID = ...
    ```
      - You can get the Discord token by creating your own bot. Follow [this guide](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) to find out how to make your bot and get your Discord token.
      - You can get the Strava Client ID and Client Secret by creating your own Strava application. Follow section B in [this guide](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/) to find out how to make your Strava app.
