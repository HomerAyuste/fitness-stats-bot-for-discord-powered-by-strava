# Fitness Stats Bot for Discord (Powered by Strava)

**This is still a work in progress.**

This Discord Bot provides fitness stats for you using Strava and sends embedded Discord messages with stats and graphs.

The repository contains the code for a Python-based Discord bot. The bot is hosted locally and makes use of the following packages:

- [interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) - A library for creating interactive message menus in Discord
- [stravalib](https://github.com/stravalib/stravalib) - A Python package for accessing Strava data from the Strava V3 web service
